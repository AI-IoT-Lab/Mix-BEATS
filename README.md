## ðŸ§  Overview

Mix-BEATS introduces a novel approach that combines **basis expansion techniques** with **Mixer architectures** to improve the performance of short-term load forecasting models. By capturing both structural and temporal patterns in energy consumption data, Mix-BEATS demonstrates strong generalization and accuracy across diverse datasets.
