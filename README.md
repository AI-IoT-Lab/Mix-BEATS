## ðŸ§  Overview

Mix-BEATS is a lightweight, hybrid model for short-term load forecasting that combines the residual learning of N-BEATS with the MLP-based patch and time mixing of TSMixer. Designed for efficiency and generalization, it achieves superior performance across diverse buildings while being suitable for edge deployment.

## Features

- **Hybrid Architecture Combining N-BEATS and TSMixer**  
  Leverages residual learning with patch and time mixing for efficient and accurate forecasting.

- **Mixer-based Temporal Modeling**  
  Applies MLP-based patch and time mixing operations inspired by vision transformers for effective time-series representation.

- **Basis Expansion Analysis**  
  Uses N-BEATS-style basis functions to improve interpretability and feature extraction.

- **Pretrained on Large-Scale, Real-World Smart Meter Data**  
  Trained on hourly consumption data from over 38,000 buildings to ensure robust generalization.

- **Lightweight and Edge-Deployable**  
  Optimized for computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**  
  Evaluated against state-of-the-art time series foundation models and generic models in zero-shot, fine-tuned, and domain-specific scenarios.

- **Open and Reproducible**  
  Publicly available codebase with training, evaluation, and benchmarking scripts for easy replication and extension.
