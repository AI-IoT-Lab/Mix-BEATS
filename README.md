## üß† Overview

Mix-BEATS is a lightweight, hybrid model for short-term load forecasting that combines the residual learning of N-BEATS with the MLP-based patch and time mixing of TSMixer. Designed for efficiency and generalization, it achieves superior performance across diverse buildings while being suitable for edge deployment.

## üìà Comparative Evaluation

We benchmark **Mix-BEATS** against state-of-the-art Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) and generic data-specific baselines across two broad settings:

---

### üîç 1. Comparison with Existing Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)

**Mix-BEATS** was evaluated against top foundation models including **Moirai**, **Chronos**, **Lag-Llama** and **Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs)**.

#### üèóÔ∏è Dataset and Evaluation Setup

- **Training Data**: 38,000 real-world building time-series from 11 datasets (see Real Building Datasets section).
- **Split Strategy**:
  - **80%** for training
  - **20%** for validation
  - **Test Set**: 1,000 unseen buildings, sampled evenly from all datasets to ensure generalization.
- **Evaluation**:
  - **Zero-shot**: Directly tested without task-specific fine-tuning.
  - **Fine-tuned**: Adapted using training split from the target dataset, without using test labels.


#### üìä Results (Zero-Shot and Fine-Tune)

**Figure 1: Performance Comparison of TSFMs (Zero-Shot & Fine-Tuned)**  
_Mix-BEATS consistently outperforms larger models despite its small size (0.18M params)_

**NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error)** ‚Äî Lower is better.  
Forecasting context length: **168 hours (7 days)**  
Forecast horizon: **24 hours (1 day)**
